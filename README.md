## My Personal Portfolio

```
A placeholder portfolio for myself until I get further into the bootcamp. "Resume" and most of the "Work Projects" are just placeholders. The only functioning one is "ZoominLife" which is the first group project we were asked to complete. The "Contact Me" section is also just placeholder links for now. 
```

## Future Development

```
In the future I hope to have all work projects REAL links to real projects. 

Contact links will be fully functional, as well as the Resume link.

It will be fully optimized for mobile.

The portfolio will also have a completely different, stylish, layout.
